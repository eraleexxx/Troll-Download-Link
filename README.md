# 🎭 Troll Download Link  

## 🚀 Description  
This is a **prank website** designed to trick users into thinking they are downloading a file.  

The site displays a **countdown timer**, and once it reaches 0, a "Download" button appears.  
When the user clicks it, they are redirected to **troll.html**, where a **VERY LOUD sound** plays to scare them.

## 📜 How It Works

## 🛠️ To-Do (Future Improvements)  
- [ ] Make the file name appear dynamically based on the URL.  
- [ ] Add a visual effect or message before the sound.  
- [ ] Allow random selection between multiple troll sounds.  
- [ ] Create an alternative version with a **screamer** instead of just sound.
